# Overview

This is a Hangman game written in Rust. The program will choose a word, display how many characters long the word is, and show the user when they guess correctly and incorrectly. The user can guess one letter at a time or they can attempt to guess the whole word at once. If the user guesses the word correctly, they win. If the user guesses incorrectly 6 times they lose.

I wrote this software to begin learning the Rust language, to practice learning languages quickly, and to practice completing a project in a short sprint.

# Development Environment

I used the C++ build tools for Visual Studio, the Rust language via rustup, and Visual Studio Code.

I used Rust exclusively when writing this program. At first, I didn't like Rust because the syntax seemed weird and was unfamiliar, but as I started to learn the language better I enjoyed programming in it more. I used the standard Rust library to get inputs from the user and the Rand library to choose a word at random.
